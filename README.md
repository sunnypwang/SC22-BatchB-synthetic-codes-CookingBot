## Cooking Recipe Generator

Our AI generates recipes based upon the ingredients that the user inputs. For example, if you enter mushrooms and chicken into our model, it will generate a recipe that includes these two ingredients. Users can specify filters and categories for their recipe by picking from multiple drop-down menus. This system can help reduce food waste and find more food options for those with specific likes and needs with what they have available.
